# Khmer Handwritten Character Recognition Using PyTorch

This project predicts handwritten **Khmer characters** from images using a **custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** implemented in **PyTorch**.  
The model classifies 10 Khmer letters with high accuracy, and all predictions are displayed in **actual Khmer script**.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset:** Khmer handwritten characters (10 classes)  
- **Classes and Khmer Characters:**

| Label | Character |
|-------|-----------|
| TA    | ត         |
| NGO   | ង         |
| CHA   | ច         |
| DA    | ដ         |
| KO    | ក         |
| NA    | ណ         |
| KHA   | ខ         |
| CHHA  | ឆ         |
| CHHO  | ឈ         |
| KHO   | ឃ         |

- **Dataset:** You can use your own collected dataset or existing ones from sources like KHMER OCR datasets
 or Kaggle. Images should be grayscale, preferably normalized to a fixed size (e.g., 48 x 48).
- **Framework:** PyTorch  
- **Model:** Custom CNN  
- **Goal:** Predict handwritten Khmer letters accurately
